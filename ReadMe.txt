The basic idea of the project is to use an android device as a game controller to
enhance the fun in the gaming experience of a user. Gaming is more fun if it is more
intuitive. All gamers feel more comfortable and realistic when they play games on
gamepad or gamecontrollers rather than on keyboards. In fact, the gaming experience
is the best when one uses a motion sensing device. Using this idea as our target, we
tried to make an application for the android devices which will make the user feel like
he/she is playing with a real motion sensing game controller.
And the most fantastic thing is that the pre-requisites are only you need to have an
android device, that’s it and then you will be able to experience the pleasure and
excitement and the fun of playing by motion sensing devices.
